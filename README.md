If you answered yes to any of these questions, then this repository is for you!

This repository provides a collection of alt codes for Gboard, the Google keyboard app for Android and iOS devices. Alt codes are keyboard shortcuts that enable you to input special characters and symbols that are not present on the standard keyboard layout. You can use these alt codes to enrich your text messages, emails, documents and more.

## Features üåü

This dictionary contains 32 words that correspond to different alt codes. Some examples are:

- `alt+1` ‚û°Ô∏è ‚ò∫
- `alt+2` ‚û°Ô∏è ‚òª
- `alt+3` ‚û°Ô∏è ‚ô•
- `alt+4` ‚û°Ô∏è ‚ô¶
- `alt+5` ‚û°Ô∏è ‚ô£
- `alt+6` ‚û°Ô∏è ‚ô†
- `alt+7` ‚û°Ô∏è ‚Ä¢
- `alt+8` ‚û°Ô∏è ‚óò
- `alt+9` ‚û°Ô∏è ‚óã
- `alt+10` ‚û°Ô∏è ‚óô

You can find the full list of words and alt codes in the [dictionary.txt](https://github.com/asurpbs/ALT-Code-Gboard-Dictionary/blob/main/dictionary.txt) file.

## How to use it üöÄ

To use this dictionary, you need to have Gboard installed on your Android or iOS device. If you don't have it yet, you can download it from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.inputmethod.latin) or the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gboard-the-google-keyboard/id1091700242).

Once you have Gboard installed, follow these steps to add this dictionary to your keyboard:

1. Download the [dictionary.txt](https://github.com/asurpbs/ALT-Code-Gboard-Dictionary/blob/main/dictionary.txt) file from this repository and save it on your device.
2. Open the Gboard app and tap on the settings icon (‚öôÔ∏è).
3. Tap on Dictionary > Personal dictionary > All languages > +.
4. Tap on Import > Browse files > Select the dictionary.txt file > Import.
5. You should see a message saying "Imported 32 words".
6. You're done! You can now use the alt codes on your keyboard.

To use the alt codes, simply type the word that corresponds to the symbol you want, followed by a space. For example, if you want to type a smiley face (‚ò∫), type `alt+1` followed by a space. The word will be replaced by the symbol automatically.

You can also access the alt codes by long pressing on the period key (.) and sliding your finger to the right until you see the ALT icon. Tap on it and you will see a list of words and symbols that you can choose from.
