# ALT-Code-Gboard-Dictionary

## Overview

This repository provides a collection of alt codes for Gboard, the Google keyboard app for Android and iOS devices. Alt codes are keyboard shortcuts that enable you to input special characters and symbols that are not present on the standard keyboard layout. You can use these alt codes to enhance your text messages, emails, documents, and more.

With this dictionary, you can:
- Enhance your texts with special symbols and characters
- Type efficiently using simple shortcuts
- Utilize alt codes on your mobile devices

- ` 6` → ♠
- ` 7` → •
