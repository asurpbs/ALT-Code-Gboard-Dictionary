# ALT-Code-Gboard-Dictionary 🎨

Do you want to spice up your texts with cool symbols? 😎

Do you want to type like a pro with simple shortcuts? 🚀

Do you want to use alt codes on your Android or iOS devices? 📱

If you answered yes to any of these questions, then this repository is for you!

This repository provides a collection of alt codes for Gboard, the Google keyboard app for Android and iOS devices. Alt codes are keyboard shortcuts that enable you to input special characters and symbols that are not present on the standard keyboard layout. You can use these alt codes to enrich your text messages, emails, documents and more.

## Features(Under Developing) 🌟

This dictionary contains some words that correspond to different alt codes. Some examples are:

- ` 1` ➡️ ☺
- ` 2` ➡️ ☻
- ` 3` ➡️ ♥
- ` 4` ➡️ ♦
- ` 5` ➡️ ♣
- ` 6` ➡️ ♠
- ` 7` ➡️ •
- ` 8` ➡️ ◘
- ` 9` ➡️ ○
- `10` ➡️ ◙

You can find the full list of words and alt codes in the [dictionary.txt](https://github.com/asurpbs/ALT-Code-Gboard-Dictionary/blob/main/dictionary.txt) file.
